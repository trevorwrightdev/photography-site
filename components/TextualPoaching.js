        I struggled during this assignment to find aspects of life as a Hoosier
        being depicted before I was born. Though I did come across this website
        that listed off Hoosier stereotypes that everyone from Indiana should
        accept. Here is the link: <br /> <br />
        <a href='https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/indiana/totally-true-stereotypes-hoosiers/'>
          https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/indiana/totally-true-stereotypes-hoosiers/
        </a>
        <br /> <br />
        I found that these stereotypes did not fit me, except for a few. Thus I
        set off to debunk some Hoosier stereotypes from my perspective. I did
        this by taking some archived footage either from online sources relating
        to Indiana, or from photos of myself, showing both the myth, and the
        truth from my respective. Everything with a red background is a
        stereotype and everything with a green background my take on that
        stereotype. Only a few are true but about 80% of them are false. This
        shows that the lack of representation and how I don’t feel a part of the
        Indiana community. Not that I am necessarily against it but that I don’t
        share the same interest as the community I grew up in. This is quite
        opposite from the #blackgirlmagic movement which united those people
        together. I am taking a stand against my home state. Some may believe
        that this is too extreme or that I am being too negative to where I grew
        up. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate everything that Indiana offered me,
        I just would like to currently move on to bigger and better things now.
        I created many of the aspects of my life in Indiana in photoshop,
        combining different elements to give it a personal touch while still
        showing bits and pieces of Indiana. This project made me think more
        about who I am and why I think that way. Does every young person feel
        the need to rebel in this way because they believe they are entitled to
        more or are they just trying to get away from their parents and make
        their own name for themselves? Taking a deeper look into this aspect of
        my life and realizing the rebellious nature I have inside me helps me to
        understand my methods of thinking now as I am in college. I try to think
        outside the box, not do what everyone else is doing, and be creative in
        this way. Sometimes this helps my college career and sometimes it
        hinders. But it is what makes me, me. In the end, my textual poaching
        helping to delve deeper into who I am as a person, which community I
        more identify with, and how to approach the future with this deeper
        understanding of myself.
